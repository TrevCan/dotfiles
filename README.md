trevcan's Omarchy setup

Omarchy is a new bootstrapped linux system
that uses wayland.

<https://omarchy.org/>

It's relatively stable. Mine got broken for some reason.
I'll try to save everything here before I reinstall it.

The configs I have are for:

- keyd: a tool for turning keys into modifier keys, e.g. turning
the TAB key into the SUPER key, or setting up a homerow mod, etcetera.
